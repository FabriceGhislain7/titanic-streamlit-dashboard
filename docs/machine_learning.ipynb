    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon comprehensive exploratory data analysis, this notebook focuses on developing predictive models to determine passenger survival on the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been split into two groups:\n",
    "- **training set (train.csv)** - Used to build and validate machine learning models\n",
    "- **test set (test.csv)** - Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set provides the outcome **(also known as the \"ground truth\")** for each passenger. Our models will be based on \"features\" like passengers' gender, class, and engineered features derived from data analysis insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is used to assess how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. Our objective is to predict these outcomes using the trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also include **gender_submission.csv**, a baseline prediction assuming all and only female passengers survive, which serves as our benchmark model."

    "2. **Model Development**: Build and compare multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Model Validation**: Use cross-validation and proper train/test methodology to avoid overfitting\n",
    "4. **Performance Optimization**: Tune hyperparameters for optimal predictive accuracy\n",
    "5. **Model Interpretation**: Understand which features drive survival predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "Our exploratory data analysis revealed several critical patterns that will guide our ML approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender**: Strong predictor - women had significantly higher survival rates\n",
    "- **Passenger Class**: Clear correlation with survival (1st > 2nd > 3rd class)\n",
    "- **Age**: Children and certain age groups showed different survival patterns  \n",
    "- **Family Size**: Optimal family sizes correlated with better survival\n",
    "- **Fare**: Economic status proxy influencing survival chances\n",
    "- **Embarkation Port**: Geographic patterns in passenger demographics\n",
